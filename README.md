# International-Astronomy-Astrophysics-Competition

Hi there!
This is my first participation in International Astronomy & Astrophysics Competition (Edition 2020).
I got nominated in both qualification and pre-final round for participating the final. 
Here I also added my certificates. 
I am pushing it in github in case if anybody needs to go through the solutions :')
